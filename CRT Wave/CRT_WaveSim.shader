Shader"SimulCat/Wave/Wave Sim CRT"
{
    /*
    A CRT is a cross between a regular shader and a compute shader.
    The output can be linked directly to the game engine graphics as a render texture similar to a camera render texture.
    
    Like a compute shader, it can be set to run independently of the graphics frame cadence allowing it to be explicitly invoked from code.
    From code, you can choose what pass to invoke, and what zone of the texture needs updating (this example does not implement zones).

    Maintaining state: While graphics shaders are stateless, the CRT can be set to be double-buffered so that the main "texture" (data) state persists from one pass to the next.

    This example is intended for dual use. First, the output can be used directly with a standard shader
    to do wave calculation across a surface and is able to be used with a standard fragment shader running on a material. This produces static output unless the CRT shader is output (e.g. with new phase to animate the waves.)

    Second, it can be set to output the raw phasor data so that custom shaders can animate or switch the display. Recommended if using lots of source data array has many points, meaning lots of summing across the source for each poin i the CRT mesh.

    To use: Pick a wave mesh resolution (best less than desired wavelength 
            it will work below this, but lots of brain damaging aliasing), 
        
            Create a render texture, but instead of the familiar camera render texture "Create->Custom Render Texture".
    
        This CustomRenderTexture defines the 
            Texture Dimension (use 2D) 
            Size ("pixels" the number of points x,y)
            Color Format ("For this experimental work 4x32Bit floats, use R32G32B32A32_SFLOAT")
            Now it might seem odd, but to hook this particular shader to the CRT you now need a material with this shader on it. 
            As I understand it, function of the material is to allow the CRT's properties to be managed and output.
            To manage the system your code basically needs to have references to the CRT and it's material.
